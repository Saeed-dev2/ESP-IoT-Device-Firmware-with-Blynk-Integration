## ESP IoT Devices Firmware with Blynk Integration

 * This Project provides a detailed overview of the firmware designed for ESP8266/ESP32 microcontrollers, utilizing the Blynk platform for remote control and monitoring. The firmware supports various board configurations and includes features such as reset button functionality, LED indicators, Over-the-Air (OTA) updates, and configuration management.
 
 * ## Overview
 * This firmware enables ESP-based IoT devices to connect to the Blynk cloud platform, providing a seamless interface for device control and monitoring. It includes components for handling button press actions, LED indication, configuration storage, and OTA updates.
 
 * ## Components
 * The firmware is modularized into several key components:
 * - **blynkagent.h** - Manages the connection between the device and the Blynk platform.
 * - **blynkstate.h** - Defines various states of the Blynk connection and device status.
 * - **configmode.h** - Manages configuration mode and handles WiFi settings.
 * - **configstore.h** - Stores device configuration settings and provides access methods.
 * - **indicator.h** - Controls LED indicators to provide status feedback.
 * - **ota.h / ota.ino** - Handles Over-the-Air (OTA) firmware updates.
 * - **resetbutton.h** - Implements button press functionality for reset and configuration actions.
 * - **settings.h** - Contains customizable settings for different board types and advanced parameters.
 
 * ## Setup and Installation
 * To compile and upload this firmware to an ESP8266 or ESP32 board, follow these steps:
 
 * ### Prerequisites
 * - **Arduino IDE** or **PlatformIO** (recommended)
 * - **ESP8266/ESP32 Board Libraries**: Ensure these are installed in the Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.
 * - **Blynk Library**: Install Blynk library for seamless integration with the Blynk cloud platform.
 
 * ### Hardware Requirements
 * - **ESP8266/ESP32 Board**
 * - **Push Button**: For reset and configuration functions.
 * - **LED (Single-Color or RGB)**: To provide device status feedback.
 * - **Power Supply (5V)**: To power the microcontroller.
 
 * ### Steps
 * 1. Clone or download the firmware code into your development environment.
 * 2. Open the project in **Arduino IDE** or **PlatformIO**.
 * 3. Select your board (ESP8266/ESP32) and configure the settings in `settings.h` based on your hardware setup.
 * 4. Compile and upload the code to your microcontroller.
 * 5. Configure Blynk authentication and WiFi credentials in `configmode.h`.
 
 * ## Usage
 * - **Button Actions**: Press and hold the button to enter configuration or reset mode.
 * - **LED Indicator**: The LED provides visual feedback on the device status (e.g., connection status, reset, or configuration mode).
 * - **Blynk Integration**: Upon connection, the device can be monitored and controlled via the Blynk app.
 * - **OTA Updates**: The firmware supports OTA updates via `ota.h` and `ota.ino`.
 *
 * ## Configuration and Settings
 * All customizable parameters, such as WiFi credentials, button configuration, and LED pin definitions, are located in `settings.h`. Adjust the following key parameters based on your board type:
 * 
 * - **BOARD_BUTTON_PIN**: Defines the button pin for reset and configuration.
 * - **BOARD_LED_PIN / RGB Pins**: Sets the LED pins for status indication.
 * - **BUTTON_HOLD_TIME_ACTION**: Specifies the duration for holding the button to trigger an action.
